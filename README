This repository contains various NetBSD tracers.

HISTORY

1. The original tracer was picotrace released on 2019-05-07.

> picotrace enables syscall trace logging for the specified processes.
> 
> The tracer uses the ptrace(2) system call to perform the tracing.
> 
> The picotrace program implements bare functionality by design.  It has
> no pretty printing of data structures or interpretation of numberical arguments
> to their corresponding syscalls.
>
> picotrace is designed to be a framework for other more advanced tracers,
> and to illustrate canonical usage of the ptrace(2).  New features are
> not expected unless they reflect a new feature in the kernel.

For historical reasons this repository is called picotrace, although
it contains now more software programs gathered in a single repository.

2. On 2019-05-08 there was imported the last BSD-3-clause version of strace.

> strace was released under a Berkeley-style license at the
> request of Paul Kranenburg.
>
> Paul was a long term NetBSD developer (pk@).
>
> This agreement was broken in 2018 as the strace developers
> relicensed the software to GPL + LGPL.

Goals of the fork called 'NetBSD strace':

 - Develop strace as a part of the picotrace repository.
 - Utilize modern NetBSD kernel interfaces.

3. On 2019-05-12 there was added coredumper.

> coredumper traces specified processes and dumps core for crashes.
> Certain programs handle program crashes with signal handlers, preventing
> core(5) files from being generated. coredumper bypasses their signal
> handlers and for each crash dumps core, without changing capturing mechanism
> in traced processes.
