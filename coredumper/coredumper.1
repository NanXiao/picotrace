.Sh NAME
.Nm coredumper
.Nd crash detector and core dumper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar CORENAME
.Op Fl i
.Oo Fl p | Ic command Oo Ar arg ... Oc Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
traces specified process and dumps core for crashes.
Certain programs handle program crashes with signal handlers,
preventing
.Xr core 5
files from being generated.
.Nm
bypasses their signal handlers and for each crash dumps core,
without changing capturing mechanism in traced processes.
.Pp
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar CORENAME
Specifies core file name.
If not set,
the default value is selected.
The syntax is specified in
.Xr core 5 .
.It Fl i
Inherit; pass the trace flags to all future children of the designated
processes.
.It Fl p Ar PID
Enable (disable) tracing on the indicated process id (only one
.Fl p
flag is permitted).
.It Ar command Op Ar args ...
Execute
.Ar command
with the specified trace flags.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl p
and
.Ar command
options are mutually exclusive.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The tracer uses the
.Xr ptrace 2
system call to perform the tracing process.
.Pp
Similar functionality can be achieved with a debugger like
.Xr gdb 1 ,
however
.Nm
is quicker and easier to setup for this specific task as tracess all children
of the main process.
.Sh EXAMPLES
# detect crashes and generate core dumps for an X session
.Dl $ coredumper -i startx
.Pp
# detect crashes and generate core dumps for a running browser
.Dl $ coredumper -i -p firefox

.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh HISTORY

.Nm
command was designed for
